Despite this being his first time being an assistant director for Model UN, he is still eager to bring an elevated conference experience to all who participate. Outside of MUN, Noah enjoys exercising in the weight room attempting to hit a new personal record or is undergoing his venture of creating 3D digital artwork. He hopes that JHMUN will breed new friendships and memories."

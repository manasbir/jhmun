However, this tends to become his way of shirking responsibility. He thinks that he has a sense of humor and always laughs at his own jokes, which, unfortunately are not funny to anybody else. He has engaged in a plethora of random extra-curriculars, and does not remember how he got into any of them. Nonetheless, MUN is something that he is extremely passionate about, particularly the lively, amusing and often quizzical debates."

Katie hopes that JHMUN 2023 will cultivate lasting memories and is ecstatic to be a part of the journey."

Upon attending her first conference, she has been drawn by the compelling debates and the fast-paced, energetic environment. Outside of MUN, Katie can be found grinding her coursework, struggling with jazz improvisations on the piano, or undertaking a service project in the community. Katie hopes that JHMUN 2023 will cultivate lasting memories and is ecstatic to be a part of the journey."

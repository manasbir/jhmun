However, this tends to become his way of shirking responsibility. He thinks that he has a sense of humor and always laughs at his own jokes, which, unfortunately are not funny to anybody else. He has engaged in a plethora of random extra-curriculars, and does not remember how he got into any of them. Nonetheless, MUN is something that he is extremely passionate about, particularly the lively, amusing and often quizzical debates."
